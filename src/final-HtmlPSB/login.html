                                <p class="m-text">Shoulder surfing is a technique wherein someone looks over you shoulder, to get information about what you are writing or typing. Shoulder surfing is an effective way to get information in crowded places, such as cyber caffe, 
                                    because it's relatively easy to stand next to someone and watch as they fill out a form, enter e-Banking User ID and Password, or enter a PIN number at an ATM machine. Shoulder surfing can also be done long distance with the aid of binoculars or other vision-enhancing devices.</p>

                                <p class="m-text">It is recommended that you shield paperwork or your keyboard from view by using your body or cupping your hand. So watch out around you before you use e-Banking from crowded place.</p>

                                    Cyber criminals use Web addresses that resemble the name of a well-known company but are slightly altered by adding, omitting, or transposing letters. For example, the address "www.microsoft.com" could appear instead as:

                                            A firewall is a barrier against anything that could compromise the security of your computer and keeps out things such as spyware, viruses, malware, hackers, etc.<br/><br/>
                                            Internet is a public network, which means that any computer that is connected to the Internet can connect to another one. A firewall scans all incoming and outgoing traffic and upon examination stops or approves that traffic. Combined with anti-spyware programs firewall boosts the security of your computer.

The X that you should always click on to close the pop-up is circled red; it is on the outside of the pop-up itself. If you close the pop up by clicking the inner X (circled in green) then you have just activated the adware/spyware. In other words, never click inside the box! <br/><br/>
                                            Now if you are still confused which X to choose to close the pop-up, just press down Alt key on your keyboard and then press F4 key. Note that Alt key should remain down when you click F4. This is for windows operating system. And, for Mac use CMD and W.

                                            How many times have you gotten an e-mail from someone you don't know, has your name on it and looks enticing enough to open it? Just clicking on a link within that particular e-mail can get you in trouble. If the sender is not who they portray themselves to be, then someone is Phishing. With you as the fish, and the e-mail as the bait. For example, you get an e-mail from your Bank asking you to provide your User ID and Password because Bank is doing some sort of enhancements in their computer system and alike.
                                             The content of the e-mail will have a sense of urgency that if you don't provide the details your online Banking account will be de-activated. Keep this in mind:<br/><br/>

                                            The best practice is to never click on a link in an e-mail. If you really want to know what's up, then go and type the exact address of the link in the address bar of your browser and see what's up. If there is nothing there, you know somebody has been Phishing.

Hackers have amazing password cracking capabilities, so the longer and more jumbled the password, the better. And don't use the same password for each account because if they get one account, they get them all.
